## General goals

Today is Nov 04 2019. I'm jumping into this [1 PPM (1 Project Per Month) challenge](https://blog.1ppm.club/). The goal is to just get things done. I will be pushing projects to Github, deploying them at random sub-domains under my own domain (or under a /projects link), 1 per month.

This is the order:

Nov 2019 - NuTrack - Nutrition Tracker
Dec 2019 - FitTrack - Workout Tracker

As soon as this month ends, I'll be moving to next project on my list and come back to put the link to it here in this page.

## What is this

An Android application that lets you log your food intake by clicking on a day in a calendar.

## What this app can't do (at this time) - Thu Nov 07 2019 2:00 AM

- On selecting a date, a new activity with 4 sections (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Snacks arranged vertically) is shown.
    Use the date selected to read corresponding data from local database and fill all those sections
